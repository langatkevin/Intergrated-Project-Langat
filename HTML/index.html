              My name is Langat Kevin, 20, and a second-year student studying computing at African Leadership College, Mauritius. My home town is Bomet, in Bomet County in Kenya, where I have grown for the better part of my life. I studied at a primary school called Kimulot Primary School before I  moved to LENANA SCHOOL in Nairobi, Kenya. I later joined Strathmore Univesity in Nairobi, Kenya, for a four-month Young Entrepreneurs Training Program offered by Strathmore Business School and sponsored by The Allan and Gill Philanthropy Africa.

              I first heard about ALU in 2015 at a career fair held at LENANA SCHOOL, where some ALU students, Catherine Njeri and Michael Mutie, at that time were present. They explained how students at ALU are working on their missions and not majors and also talked about student-based learning. This increased my curiosity about the school, and I could not wait to finish high school and apply to ALU. In my last high school term, I applied to ALU in 2018 and was accepted. I, however, had to defer my admission because I did not have my academic papers yet. My preferred campus was ALC, and unfortunately, 2019 did not offer any scholarships, and I had to defer my admission for the second time. My application was rescinded in 2020, and I had to start my application all over again because the qualifications and application process had changed. I got accepted again and was excited when I got my flight ticket. Moving to ALU was one of the best moments in my life because I was moving out of the country, and it meant getting on the plane for the first time. Meeting diverse students from all over the continent was amazing. It meant learning about their way of life, culture and food. I first wanted to study Social Science but later changed to Computing because I am more interested in data analysis. I could only focus and learn more about it by studying Computing. The classes have been excellent, as we learn a lot from our facilitators and fellow students. Collaborating with students has also been helpful in my areas of struggle, as I can get help from a group member. I advise prospective students to maximize the opportunities ALU offers, always do their best and follow their dreams. They should also not be afraid to fail as it is part of learning. My time at ALU has been fantastic; I have met many amazing people worldwide and learnt a lot. I have also learned a lot about myself and have been able to realize my true potential.

              <p class="card-excerpt">
                I have had a fantastic experience in Mauritius. The experience has been wow! I travelled a lot during my first year and even got an award for travelling. Travelling comes with other adventures, and one thing that I have come to love is photography. Starting from point zero to becoming an ALU marketing intern is one of the most significant steps I took in my first year. I also learnt how to drive in Mauritius and even got into the taxi business. I also faced some challenges, like when my friend caused an accident, and we had to pay for the damages.

              Apart from studies, travelling and working, I have an amazing Social Life. I like going to parties with friends and hanging out. I also participate in social projects both on and off campus. At home, I run a C.B.O. called Tunza Community Based Organisation, whose main objective is to solve challenges faced by kids in public primary schools in rural parts of Kenya. I recently founded a startup called Legim Farm in Mauritius to produce organic, chemical-free, healthy vegetables for the Mauritian community.

              I am looking forward to venturing into the Data Analysis field as it is a field that has been fascinating to me. Furthering my studies beyond the Masters's level in Data Analysis is what I am looking forward to achieving. Eventually, working at big companies like Google would be an ideal career satisfaction. I also look forward to solving food insecurity worldwide, especially in Africa, using the Circular Economy methods in hydroponic farming.
